## Configuration

### Access Settings
- Open VS Code settings
- Search for "stackcode"
- Or edit `settings.json` directly

### Available Settings

```json
{
  // Enable/disable all proactive notifications
  "stackcode.notifications.enabled": true,
  
  // Show notifications when working on main/develop branch
  "stackcode.notifications.branchCheck": true,
  
  // Show notifications for unconventional commit messages
  "stackcode.notifications.commitCheck": true
}
```

## Best Practices Integration

The extension encourages GitFlow workflow:

1. **Feature Development**:
   - Work on feature branches (`feature/branch-name`)
   - Use conventional commits
   - Include proper documentation

2. **Code Quality**:
   - Maintain project structure
   - Follow naming conventions
   - Include essential project files

3. **Git Workflow**:
   - Avoid direct commits to main/develop
   - Use descriptive commit messages
   - Regular branch cleanup

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Showing Notifications

1. Check if notifications are enabled:
   ```json
   "stackcode.notifications.enabled": true
   ```

2. Verify workspace has a git repository
3. Reload VS Code window: `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Developer: Reload Window"

### Git Integration Issues

1. Ensure Git extension is enabled
2. Verify repository is properly initialized
3. Check git status in terminal

### Performance Issues

1. Disable specific notification types if needed
2. Check VS Code developer console for errors
3. Restart VS Code

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Workflows

The extension can be extended to support custom workflows:

1. Modify branch naming patterns
2. Add custom commit types
3. Configure project-specific rules

### Integration with Other Tools

- Works alongside GitLens
- Compatible with Git Graph
- Integrates with conventional changelog tools

## Feedback and Support

- Report issues on GitHub
- Suggest new features
- Contribute to development

Remember: The goal is to reinforce best practices without being intrusive. All notifications can be customized or disabled based on your preferences.
