## Reporting a Vulnerability

The StackCode team and community take all security vulnerabilities seriously. Thank you for your effort to responsibly disclose your findings. We appreciate your help in keeping our project secure.

To report a security vulnerability, please use the **[Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/YagoBorba/StackCode/security/advisories/new)** feature on GitHub. This will ensure your finding is disclosed privately and reaches the project maintainers directly.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

We will make every effort to respond to your report within 48 hours. Once the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a patch and release it as quickly as possible. We will credit you for your discovery unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
